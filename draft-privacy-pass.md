authenticating to services on the internet.

# Introduction

In some situations, it may only be necessary to check that a client has
previously authenticated to a service; without learning any other information.
Such lightweight authentication mechanisms can be useful in quickly assessing
the reputation of a client in latency-sensitive communication.

The Privacy Pass protocol was initially introduced as a mechanism for
authenticating clients that had previously demonstrated their `honesty`
{{DGSTV18}}. In particular, the Cloudflare content delivery network (CDN)
has implemented server-side support for the Privacy Pass protocol {{PPSRV}}. This
support allows clients to bypass security mechanisms, providing that they have
successfully passed these mechanisms previously. There is also a client-side
implementation in the form of a browser extension that interacts with the
Cloudflare network {{PPEXT}}.

The main security requirement of the Privacy Pass protocol is to ensure that
previously authenticated clients do not reveal their identity on
reauthentication. The protocol uses a cryptographic primitive known as a
verifiable oblivious pseudorandom function (VOPRF) for implementing the
authentication mechanism. In particular, the VOPRF is constructed in prime-order
groups. In particular, this allows it to be implemented using elliptic curves
{{OPRF}}. The protocol is split into three stages. The first two stages,
initialisation and evaluation, are essentially equivalent to the VOPRF setup and
evaluation phases from {{OPRF}}. The final stage, redemption, essentially
amounts to revealing the client's secret inputs in the VOPRF protocol. The
security (pseudorandomness) of the VOPRF protocol means that the client retains
their privacy even after revealing this data.

In this document, we will give a formal specification of the Privacy Pass
protocol in the internet setting. In particular, we will specify how
communication is achieved over HTTP, comparisons with different functionality
and efficiency configurations, and how the OPRF protocol should be integrated
into the wider Privacy Pass protocol workflow.

## Terminology

The following terms are used throughout this document.

- PRF: Pseudorandom function
- VOPRF: Verifiable oblivious PRF {{OPRF}}
- Server: A service that provides access to a certain resource (sometimes
  denoted S)
- Client: An entity that seeks to authenticate to a server (sometimes denoted C)

## Preliminaries

Throughout this draft, let D be some object corresponding to an opaque data type
(such as a group element). We write []byte(D) to denote the encoding of this
data type as raw bytes. We assume that such objects can also be interpreted as
Buffer objects, with each internal slot in the buffer set to the value of the
one of the bytes. For two objects x and y, we denote the concatenation of the
bytes of these objects by ([]byte(x) .. []byte(y)). We assume that all bytes are
first base64-encoded before they are sent as part of a protocol message.

We use the notation [ Ti ] to indicate an array of objects T1, ... , TQ where
the size of the array is Q, and the size of Q is implicit from context.

## Layout

- {{overview}}: A generic overview of the Privacy Pass protocol based on VOPRFs.
- {{browser}}: Instructions on how to integrate the Privacy Pass protocol into
  the browser setting.
- {{exts}}: Extensions to the Privacy Pass protocol and browser integration that
  allow for more specific functionality.
- {{security}}: Security considerations and recommendations arising from the
  usage of the Privacy Pass protocol.
- {{encoding}}: Valid data encodings for all objects that are in transit during
  the protocol.

## Requirements

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in {{RFC2119}}.

# Generalized protocol overview {#overview}

In this document, we will be assuming that a client (C) is attempting to
authenticate itself in a lightweight manner to a server (S). The authentication
mechanism should not reveal to the server anything about the client; in
addition, the client should not be able to forge valid credentials in situations
where it does not possess any.

In this section, we will give a broad overview of how the Privacy Pass protocol
functions in achieving these goals. The generic protocol can be split into three
phases: initialisation, issuance and redemption. As we mentioned previously, the
first two stages are essentially identical to the setup and evaluation phases of
the VOPRF in {{OPRF}}. The last stage, redemption, corresponds to the client
revealing their secret input data during the VOPRF protocol to the server. The
server can use this data to confirm that the client has a valid VOPRF output,
without being able to link the data to any individual issuance phase.

Throughout this document we adhere to the recommendations laid out in {{OPRF}}
in integrating the VOPRF protocol into our wider workflow. Where necessary, we
lay out exactly which VOPRF API functionality we use. We stress that the
generalized protocol only includes steps and messages that contain cryptographic
data. In {{browser}}, we discuss how to implement the protocol in the browser
setting, along with appropriate message encodings and formats.

## Key initialisation phase

In the initialisation phase, essentially we run the VOPRF setup phase in that
the server runs VOPRF_Setup(l) where l is the required bit-length of the prime
used in establishing the order of the group GG. This outputs the tuple (k,Y,p)
where: p = p(l) is the prime order of GG = GG(l); k is a uniformly sampled
element from GF(p); and Y = kG for some fixed generator of GG.

However, the server must first come to an agreement on what group instantiation
to support. This involves choosing an instantiation with the required security
level implied by the choice of l. The server has a list of supported group
params (GROUP_PARAMS) and chooses an identifier, id, associated with the
preferred group configuration, and also outputs the implied length of l. It
creates a Privacy Pass key object denoted by ppKey that has fields "private",
"public" and "group". It sets ppKey.private = []byte(k), ppKey.public =
[]byte(Y) and ppKey.group = id.

The server creates a JSON object of the form below.

~~~
{
  "Y": pp_key.public
  "expiry": <expiry_date>
  "sig": <signature>
}
~~~

The field "expiry" corresponds to an expiry date for the newly sampled key. We
recommend that each key has a lifetime of between 1 month and 1 year. The field
"sig" holds an ASN1-encoded ECDSA signature evaluated over the contents of "Y"
and "expiry". The ECDSA parameters should be equivalent to the group
instantiation used for the OPRF, and the signing key (ecdsaSK) should be
long-term with a corresponding publicly available verification key (ecdsaVK). We
summarize the creation of this object using the algorithm PP_key_init(), which
we define below.

~~~
function PP_key_init(k, Y, id) {
  ppKey.private = []byte(k)
  ppKey.public = []byte(Y)
  ppKey.group = id
  var today = new Date()
  var expiry = today.setMonth(today.getMonth() + n);
  var obj = {
    Y: ppKey.public,
    expiry: expiry,
    sig: ECDSA.sign(ecdsaSK, ppKey.public .. []byte(expiry)),
  }
  return [ppKey, obj]
}
~~~

Note that the variable n above should correspond to the number of months ahead
that the expiry date should correspond to.

We give a diagrammatic representation of the initialisation phase below.

~~~
C(ecdsaVK)                                        S(ecdsaSK)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                  l = GROUP_PARAMS[id]
                                                  (k,Y,p) = VOPRF_Setup(l)
                                                  [ppKey,obj] = PP_key_init(k,Y,id)

                                     obj
                            <-------------------

public := key.public
if (!ECDSA.verify(ecdsaVK, obj.Y .. []byte(obj.expiry)) {
  panic(ECDSA_VERIFICATION_FAILED)
} else if (!(new Date() < obj.expiry)) {
  panic(COMMITMENT_EXPIRED_ERROR)
}
store(obj.id, obj.public)                            push(key)
~~~

The variable obj essentially corresponds to a cryptographic commitment to the
server's VOPRF key. We abstract all signing and verification of ECDSA signatures
into the ECDSA.sign and ECDSA.verify functionality {{DSS}}.

### Trusted registry

Rather than sending the result of the key initialisation procedure directly to
each client, it is preferable to upload the object obj to a trusted,
tamper-proof, history-preserving registry. By trusted, we mean from the
perspective of clients that use the Privacy Pass protocol. Any new keys uploaded
to the registry should be appended to the list. Any keys that have expired can
optionally be labelled as so, but should never be removed. A trusted registry
may hold key commitments for multiple Privacy Pass service providers (servers).

Clients can either choose to:

- poll the trusted registry and import new keys, rejecting any that throw
  errors;
- retrieve the commitments for the server at the time at which they are used,
  throwing errors if no valid commitment is available.

To prevent unauthorized modification of the trusted registry, server's should be
required to identify and authenticate themselves before they can append data to
their configuration. Moreover, only parts of the registry that correspond to the
servers configuration can be modifiable.

### Key rotation

Whenever a server seeks to rotate their key, they must append their key to the
trusted registry. We recommend that the trusted registry is arranged as a JSON
blob with a member for each JSON provider. Each provider appends new keys by
creating a new sub-member corresponding to an incremented version label along
with their new commitment object.

Concretely, we recommend that the trusted registry is a JSON file of the form
below.

~~~
{
  "server_1": {
    "ciphersuite": ...,
    "1.0": {
      "Y": ...,
      "expiry": ...,
      "sig": ...,
    },
    "1.1": {
      "Y": ...,
      "expiry": ...,
      "sig": ...,
    },
  }
  "server_2": {
    "ciphersuite": ...,
    "1.0": {
      "Y": ...,
      "expiry": ...,
      "sig": ...,
    },
  },
  ...
}
~~~

In this structure, "server_1" and "server_2" are separate service providers. The
sub-member "ciphersuite" corresponds to the choice of VOPRF ciphersuite made by
the server. The sub-members "1.0", "1.1" of "server_1" correspond to the
versions of commitments available to the client. Increasing version numbers
should correspond to newer keys. Each commitment should be a valid encoding of a
point corresponding to the group in the VOPRF ciphersuite specified in
"ciphersuite".

If "server_2" wants to upload a new commitment with version tag "1.1", it runs
the key initialisation procedure from above and adds a new sub-member "1.1" with
the value set to the value of the output obj. The "server_2" member should now
take the form below.

~~~
{
  ...
  "server_2": {
    "ciphersuite": ...,
    "1.0": {
      "Y": ...,
      "expiry": ...,
      "sig": ...,
    },
    "1.1": {
      "Y": ...,
      "expiry": ...,
      "sig": ...,
    },
  },
  ...
}
~~~


### Client retrieval

We define a function retrieve(server_id, version_id) which retrieves the
commitment with version label equal to version_id, for the provider denoted by
the string server_id. For example, retrieve("server_1","1.1") will retrieve the
member labelled with "1.1".

We implicitly assume that this function performs the following verification
checks:

~~~
if (!ECDSA.verify(ecdsaVK, obj.Y .. []byte(obj.expiry)) {
  return "error"
} else if (!(new Date() < obj.expiry)) {
  return "error"
}
~~~

If "error" is not returned, then it instead returns the entire object. We also
abuse notation and also use ciph = retrieve(server_id, "ciphersuite") to refer
to retrieving the ciphersuite for the server configuration.

### Key revocation

If a server must revoke a key, then it uses a separate member with label
"revoke" corresponding to an array of revoke versions associated with key
commitments. In the above example, if "server_2" needs to revoke the key with
version "1.0", then it appends a new "revoke" member with the array [ "1.0" ].
Any future revocations can simply be appended to this array. For an example, see
below.

~~~
{
  ...
  "server_2": {
    "ciphersuite": ...,
    "1.0": {
      "Y": ...,
      "expiry": ...,
      "sig": ...,
    },
    "1.1": {
      "Y": ...,
      "expiry": ...,
      "sig": ...,
    },
    "revoked": [ "1.0" ],
  },
  ...
}
~~~

Client's are required to check the "revoked" member for new additions when they
poll the trusted registry for new key data.

### VOPRF ciphersuites

Following the recommendations in {{OPRF}}, we assume that a server uses only one
VOPRF ciphersuite at any one time. Should a server choose to change some aspect
of the ciphersuite (e.g., the group instantiation or other cryptographic
functionality)  we recommend that the server create a new identifying label
(e.g. "server_1_${ciphersuite_id}") where ciphersuite_id corresponds to the
identifier of the VOPRF ciphersuite. Then "server_1" revokes all keys for the
previous ciphersuite and then only offers commitments for the current label.

An alternative arrangement would be to add a new layer of members between server
identifiers and key versions in the JSON struct, corresponding to
ciphersuite_id. Then the client may choose commitments from the appropriate
group identifying member.

We strongly recommend that service providers only operate with one group
instantiation at any one time. If a server uses two VOPRF ciphersuites at any
one time then this may become an avenue for segregating the user-base. User
segregation can lead to privacy concerns relating to the utility of the
obliviousness of the VOPRF protocol (as raised in {{OPRF}}). We discuss this
more in ...

### ECDSA key material

For clients must also know the verification (ecdsaVK) for each service provider
that they support. This enables the client to verify that the commitment is
properly formed before it uses it. We do not provide any specific
recommendations on how the client has access to this key, beyond that the
verification key should be accessible separately from the trusted registry.

While the number of service providers associated with Privacy Pass is low, the
client can simply hardcode the verification keys directly for each provider that
they support. This may be cumbersome if a provider wants to rotate their signing
key, but since these keys should be comparatively long-term (relative to the
VOPRF key schedule), then this should not be too much of an issue.

## Issuance phase

The issuance phase allows the client to receive VOPRF evaluations from the
server. The issuance phase essentially corresponds to a VOPRF evaluation phase
{{OPRF}}. In essence, the client generates a valid VOPRF input x (a sequence of
bytes from some unpredictable distribution), and runs the VOPRF evaluation phase
with the server. The client receives an output y of the form:

~~~
    dk = H_2("voprf_derive_key", x .. []byte(N))
    y = H_2(dk, aux)
~~~

where H_2 is a function defined in {{OPRF}} that is modeled as a random oracle,
N is a group element, and aux is auxiliary data that is generated by the client.
More specifically, N is an unblinded group element equal to k*H_1(x) where H_1
is a random oracle that outputs elements in GG. The client stores (x, y) as
recommended in {{OPRF}}. We give a diagrammatic overview of the protocol below.

~~~
C(x, aux)                                 S(ppKey)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
var ciph = retrieve(S.id, "ciphersuite")
var (r,M) = VOPRF_Blind(x)

                       []byte(M)
                  ------------------>

                                        (Z,D) = VOPRF_Eval(ppKey.private,ciph.G,Y,M)
                                        var resp = {
                                          element: []byte(Z),
                                          proof: []byte(D),
                                          version: "key_version",
                                        }

                          resp
                  <------------------

var elt = resp.element
var proof = resp.proof
var version = resp.version
var obj = retrieve(S.id, version)
if obj == "error" {
  panic(INVALID_COMMITMENT_ERROR)
}
var N = VOPRF_Unblind(G,Y,M,elt,proof)
var y = VOPRF_Finalize(x,N,aux)
if (y == "error") {
  panic(CLIENT_VERIFICATION_ERROR)
}

push((ciph,x,y,aux))
~~~

In the diagram above, the client knows the VOPRF ciphersuite supported by the
server when it retrieves in the first step. It uses this information to
correctly perform group operations before sending the first message.

## Redemption phase

The redemption phase allows the client to reauthenticate to the server, using
data that it has received from a previous issuance phase. By the security of the
VOPRF, even revealing the original input x that is used in the issuance phase
does not affect the privacy of the client. In other words, no server should be
able to link a client redemption request to any particular with issuance phase,
except for negligible probability.

~~~
C()                                     S(ppKey)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
var ciph1 = retrieve(S.id, "ciphersuite")
a = pop()
while (a != undefined) {
  (ciph2,x,y,aux) = a
  if (ciph1 != ciph2) {
    // ciphersuites do not match
    a = pop()
    continue
  }
}
if (!a) {
  // no valid data to redeem
  return
}

                    (x,y,aux)
              -------------------->

                                      T = H1(x)
                                      N' = OPRF_Eval(ppKey.private, T)
                                      y' = OPRF_Finalize(x,N',aux)
                                      resp = (y' == y) ? "success" : "failure"

                      resp
              <--------------------

output resp
~~~

Note that the server uses the API provided by OPRF_Eval and OPRF_Finalize,
rather than the corresponding VOPRF functions. This is because the VOPRF
functions also compute zero-knowledge proof data that we do not require at this
stage of the protocol.

# Browser integrations {#browser}

We discuss possible use-cases and potential APIs for using Privacy Pass in the
browser setting.

## Per-origin trust {#per-origin}

We cover a use-case of the Privacy Pass protocol to allow origins to associate
trust with browsers in which the client browsing activity should not be tracked.
In particular, we discuss an API that allows the browser to store data issued in
a Privacy Pass exchange in per-origin storage areas. This data can later be
redeemed in third-party contexts where the user may be unknown, or have a low
associated trust score.

We provide a browser API that allows users browsing on a certain origin to
perform Privacy Pass issuance interactions, where the origin acts as the server
in the Privacy Pass protocol. We then describe how third-party origins can
invoke redemptions from a client for this issuer, so that the third-party can
learn whether the issuer trusts the client. This allows the third-party to
inform their own decision-making about the client, without harming their
privacy.

The API that we detail is based on the API first detailed
[here](https://github.com/WICG/trust-token-api).

### Issuance

#### Assumptions

- There is a client C that is a browser context operated by O (for some origin
  issuer.com). C implements the role of the client in Privacy Pass issuance.
- O is a Privacy Pass issuer, and implements the server in the issuance phase.
- C will the output of the issuance phase and store this in a per-origin
  partition of the browser storage. Each individual output will be referred to
  as a Trust Token.
- O has uploaded their Privacy Pass key commitment to a trusted registry known
  to the client.

#### API

When O wants to provide trust tokens to C, they use a Javascript API that
invokes fetch:

~~~
fetchTrustTokens("/request-tokens").then(...)
~~~

This API function will perform the following operations:

- Generate a set of random nonces denoted x1, ... , xQ as separate Buffer
  objects.
- Runs VOPRF_Blind(xi) for i in 1...Q and parses the response as a pair of
  Buffers denoted by (ri,Mi). Each Mi is a valid encoding of a group element
  {{encoding}} as a Buffer object.
- Create a HTTP request with the following set:
  - method: POST
  - path: /request-tokens
  - body: {"data":[ base64(M1), ... , base64(MQ) ]}
- Send the HTTP request.

The HTTP response for a successfully processed request should be of the form
below.

~~~
    status: 200
    body: {
      "result": {
        "tokens":[ base64(Z1), ... , base64(ZQ) ],
        "proof":[ base64(D1), ... base64(DQ) ],
        "version":"1.0"
      }
    }
~~~

The key version "1.0" here should be set to the version string used by O for the
latest key that it has issued. We use D1,...,DQ to refer to individual VOPRF
proof objects {{OPRF}}. These are each made up of a pair of Buffer objects. Note
that it is possible to use the batching technique described in {{OPRF}} to batch
each of these into a single proof object at the expense of slightly more
server-side computation. The modified batched response is given below.

~~~
    body: {
      "result": {
        "tokens":[ base64(Z1), ... , base64(ZQ)],
        "proof":base64(D),
        "version":"1.0"
      }
    }
~~~

In the following, we will assume that proof objects are not batched for
simplicity. If an error occurred the response should take the form:

- status: 400
- body: {"error":{"message": "error message","code": error_code}}

where error_code is a numeric error code corresponding to the error that
occurred. In the event of an error occurring, the promise rejects.

In the success case, the client parses the JSON blob and decodes each
entry, before performing the following steps:

- Retrieves (G,Y) from the trusted commitment registry entry for O for key
  version "1.0".
- Runs Ni = VOPRF_Unblind(ri,G,Y,Mi,Zi,Di) for each i in 1...Q.
- If Ni == "error", discard (xi,Ni).
- Stores (xi,Ni) as Buffer objects in the O portion of the browser's per-origin
  Privacy Pass storage.

Notice that this final step does not run VOPRF_Finalize yet. The reason for
this, is that we choose to run VOPRF_Finalize on auxiliary data that is taken
generated at the time of redemption.

### Redemption

#### Assumptions

- Client C has valid Trust Tokens for O (issuer.com)
- Client C is browsing another origin OV (vendor.com).
- Either OV is interested in learning whether O trusts C, or O embeds a script
  on OV that checks the trust status of C. We assume that these two scenarios
  are identical for now.

#### API

A new Javascript API is provided that allows OV to determine whether C has Trust
Tokens issued by O.

~~~
fetchTrustAttestation("issuer.com", {"policy":["use-cache","refresh"]}).then(...)
~~~

If there are no tokens available for O, then the promise rejects. Otherwise the
API functionality invokes the following operations in the browser.

- Obtain (x,N) from the per-origin Privacy Pass storage for O
- Generate a random string denoted by nonce.
- Let rb be a Buffer containing the concatenation of the following bytes:
  - []byte("issuer.com") .. []byte("vendor.com") .. []byte(nonce).
- Run y = VOPRF_Finalize(x,N,rb)
- Create a HTTP request with the following information:
  - method: POST
  - path: /redeem-tokens
  - body: {"data":y,"bindings":[ "issuer.com", "vendor.com", nonce ]}
- Send the HTTP request to O.

The HTTP response for a successful request should take the following form.

~~~
    status: 200
    body: {
      "result": {
        "timestamp":"2019-10-09-11:06:11",
        "top-level":"vendor.com",
      },
      "signature":sig,
    }
~~~

The "timestamp" field should be set to the time that the server processed the
redemption request, "top-level" is set to the top-level origin OV host value.
The field "signature" is a signature, sig, evaluated over all of the fields in
"result" that is verifiable using a well-known public key for O. If an error
occurs, the format is the same as in the issuance phase, and the promise
rejects.

On success, the above record is known as a signed redemption response (SRR).
This SRR is then sent by C to OV, and OV validates the signature over the
provided data to determine the result of the trust assertion. In general, these
records are available to HTTP-only browser APIs. Such records can be forwarded
as a new option in the fetch API:

~~~
fetch(<resource-url>, {
  ...
  signedRedemptionRecord: [issuer],
  ...
});
~~~

This includes the SRR object as the value of a header
"Sec-Signed-Redemption-Record". This fetch option is only available in the
top-level document.

#### Preventing token depletion

To prevent OV from depleting the set of tokens that C has for O, the SRRs above
are cached in first-party browser storage. If OV wants to learn about the trust
attestation of C to O and C has a cached SRR for OV, then it sends this record;
rather than performing an entirely new redemption with O.

If O has an embedded iframe in OV, and would like to refresh the SRR that C
holds, it can use the "policy" settings of "fetchTrustAttestation" to refresh
the SRR that the client holds.
