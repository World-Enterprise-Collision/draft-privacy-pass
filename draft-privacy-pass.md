This document specifies the Privacy Pass protocol for anonymously
authenticating to services on the internet.

# Introduction

In some situations, it may only be necessary to check that a client has
previously authenticated to a service; without learning any other information.
Such lightweight authentication mechanisms can be useful in quickly assessing
the reputation of a client in latency-sensitive communication.

The Privacy Pass protocol was initially introduced as a mechanism for
authenticating clients that had previously demonstrated their `honesty`
{{DGSTV18}}. In particular, the Cloudflare content delivery network (CDN)
has implemented server-side support for the Privacy Pass protocol {{PSRV}}. This
support allows clients to bypass security mechanisms, providing that they have
successfully passed these mechanisms previously. There is also a client-side
implementation in the form of a browser extension that interacts with the
Cloudflare network {{PPEXT}}.

The main security requirement of the Privacy Pass protocol is to ensure that
previously authenticated clients do not reveal their identity on
reauthentication. The protocol uses a cryptographic primitive known as a
verifiable oblivious pseudorandom function (VOPRF) for implementing the
authentication mechanism. In particular, the VOPRF is constructed in prime-order
groups that allow it to be implemented using elliptic curve cryptography
{{OPRF}}.

In this document, we will give a formal specification of the Privacy Pass
protocol in the internet setting. In particular, we will specify how
communication is achieved over HTTP, comparisons with different functionality
and efficiency configurations, as well as strategies for performing secure key
rotation.
